## 🧭 UI-UX Scroll Mechanics
Scrolling is one of the most fundamental interactions in frontend development — yet it is often treated as an afterthought. This github organization, is a collection of private repositories that explores:
1. How scrolling works at the browser level
2. How scroll position becomes UI data
3. How layouts behave inside different scroll contexts
4. How to design scroll-driven interfaces intentionally
5. How to implement performant, production-ready scroll systems
<br/>
Each repository focuses on one clearly defined scroll concept and implements it using React + TypeScript with an emphasis on clean mental models and performance awareness.

### 📚 Some Topics Covered
1. Scroll as a Coordinate System
2. Horizontal Scrolling Foundations
3. Scroll Snap Behaviour
4. Scroll Threshold/End Detection
5. Programmatic Scroll Control
6. Vertical Scroll Progress
